Lab Project 05 for CSE220 @ ASU, Fall 2011.   (replaces P04 which may be completed for extra credit)
This project consists of an assembler for the K1 microcontroller.  An assembler is a program which translates code written in the assembly language of a microprocessor into equivalent binary machine language.


THE PLAN: 
1) create a mercurial repository: ~/Dropbox/classes/CSE220/p05/
2) write a main that does SOMEthing
3) ALWAYS keep the code in a running state
4) write small, testable components and move on when each passes
